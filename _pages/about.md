I'm a last-year Ph.D. student in MIT, EECS Department, where I am very fortunately advised by [Srinivas Devadas](https://people.csail.mit.edu/devadas). Prior to this, I earned my M.S. degree in Computer Science from MIT in 2019 and my B.S. degree in Mathematics from Tsinghua University in 2017. 

Iâ€™m on the job market of Fall 2023!

I am broadly interested in information security, privacy and robust statistics. I endeavor to establish theory and tools for provable, interpretable and usable security and privacy exploiting statistical, information-theoretical and cryptographic methods. In particular, I focus on 

1. semantic and rigorous measures which are accessible to a general audience with board expressibility of security and privacy concerns;
2. end-to-end automatic privacy proof and privacy-preserving technology that accommodates cutting-edge advancements in data science and machine learning;
3. fundamental relationship between security & privacy and (Byzantine/Adversarial) robustness and algorithm co-design.

My earlier works encompass a range of related topics including Byzantine consensus and proof of work in applied cryptography, and constrained sampling theory in signal processing.

I was a recipient of [Mathwork Fellowship](https://engineering.mit.edu/fellows/hanshen-xiao/) (2021-2023) and [Tsinghua Future Scholar Fellowship](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/jyjx/yjsjy/jztx.htm) (2016-2017) . My research has also been supported and funded by [DSTA, Singapore](https://www.dsta.gov.sg/home), [Captical One](https://www.capitalone.com) and [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com/#tabs-9cfa4a460b-item-b8ba101fed-tab).
