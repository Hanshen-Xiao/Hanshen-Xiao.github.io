I'm currently a post-doc researcher at NVIDIA Research. Starting in the Fall of 2025, I will be an assistant professor in the [Department of Computer Science at Purdue University](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/). I received my PhD degree from the EECS Department of MIT advised by [Srini Devadas](https://people.csail.mit.edu/devadas). Previously, I earned my B.S. degree in Mathematics from Tsinghua University. 


I am broadly interested in information privacy, security and robust statistics. I endeavor to establish theory and tools for provable, interpretable and usable security and privacy exploiting statistical, information-theoretical and cryptographic methods. In particular, I focus on 

1. semantic and rigorous measures which are accessible to a general audience with board expressibility of security and privacy concerns ([CRYPTO 2023](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-38545-2_20));
2. end-to-end automatic privacy proof and privacy-preserving technology ([IEEE S&P 2025](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/718.pdf)) that accommodates cutting-edge advancements in data science and machine learning ([ICML 2020](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/wang20y/wang20y.pdf), [PODS 2022](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3517804.3524144), [CCS 2024](https://people.csail.mit.edu/devadas/pubs/Learnable_Obfuscation.pdf));
3. fundamental relationship between security & privacy, the minimal utility/efficiency overhead ([CCS 2023](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3576915.3623142), [IEEE S&P 2023](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10179409)) and (Byzantine/Adversarial) robustness ([SODA 2024](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/1.9781611977912.115)) for simultaneous algorithm improvement.

My earlier works encompass a range of related topics including Byzantine consensus ([TCC 2020a](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/590.pdf), [TCC 2020b](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1236.pdf)), and proof of work ([TCC 2017](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/904.pdf)) in applied cryptography, and constrained sampling theory in signal processing ([IEEE-TSP 2023a](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10049583), [IEEE-TSP 2023b](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10050789)).

I was a recipient of [Mathwork Fellowship](https://engineering.mit.edu/fellows/hanshen-xiao/) (2021-2023) and [Tsinghua Future Scholar Fellowship](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/jyjx/yjsjy/jztx.htm) (2015-2017) . My research has also been supported and funded by [DSTA, Singapore](https://www.dsta.gov.sg/home), [Captical One](https://www.capitalone.com) and [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com/#tabs-9cfa4a460b-item-b8ba101fed-tab). 

I am always looking for students who are passionate about developing useful theory to guide practical solutions. If you're interested in working with me, feel free to send me your CV.
